To get up and running, you'll need to install your modules using NPM.

```npm install```

Once that's done, you'll need to install webpack globally so as to have access to the command line tool.

```npm install webpack -g```

Then, you can run webpack to transpile all of your JSX into JavaScript. Throw in a -w (webpack -w) to have it watch for your changes. Then open dist/index.html in a browser and you're good to go.
